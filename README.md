# CornField AI

CornField AI is a local-first browser video player for personal libraries.

It keeps your original files on disk, stores app state locally, and gives you a fast browser UI for browsing, tagging, rating, watching, and summarizing your own video library preferences.

No sample media is bundled in this repository. You point CornField AI at your own video folder on first use.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+ recommended
- macOS or Windows
- A local or mounted video library folder you want to index

## Launching

macOS:
- Double-click `openCornField.command`

Windows:
- Double-click `openCornField.cmd`

If macOS blocks the first launch, open `System Settings > Privacy & Security` and click `Open Anyway`, then launch it again.

It will:
1. Open the official Node.js download page if Node.js is missing
2. Install dependencies on first run
3. Start the local server
4. Open CornField AI in your browser

On Windows, no extra permission step is usually needed for `openCornField.cmd`.

## First-Time Setup

1. Open `Settings`.
2. Set `Library Folder Path` to your video folder.
3. Click `Scan Library`.

## Scan Behavior

- New files are added to DB with detected resolution/quality
- Missing files are removed from DB on scan
- Unused tags and starring entries are cleaned up automatically
- Files starting with `._` are ignored during scan/listing
- For newly added videos without a thumbnail, CornField AI tries to capture a frame near the middle of the video

## Features

- Scan a local folder or mounted NAS path and index videos automatically
- Edit metadata per video: title, description, upload date, category, tags, starring, and view count
- Keep file names as-is by default, with optional real file rename
- Detect quality from resolution (`720p+`, `1080p+`, `1440p+`, etc.)
- Search across title, file name, category, quality, tags, and starring
- Browse related videos based on shared tags, starring, and category
- Leave comments, ratings, and timeline notes
- Upload, capture, or auto-generate thumbnails
- Hover the player seek bar to preview nearby frames
- Use keyboard shortcuts and persistent player preferences
- Track watch sessions locally for preference analysis
- Generate a simple AI preference summary from your local viewing signals

## AI Setup

CornField AI does not bundle an AI account or API key. Add your own OpenAI-compatible API key in Settings, or launch with `AI_API_KEY`, `AI_BASE_URL`, and `AI_MODEL` environment variables.

The app stores a Settings key locally in `data/videoplayer.db`. Only library metadata and viewing signals used for the summary are sent to the configured AI API when you click Generate Summary.

## Technical Notes

### Manual Launch

If you are developing locally or launching without the desktop helper:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open: [http://127.0.0.1:4300](http://127.0.0.1:4300)

### Local Data

- Your media files stay in their original folders and are not copied by default.
- App data is stored in `data/videoplayer.db`.
- Generated or uploaded thumbnails are stored in `data/thumbnails/`.
- Seek-bar hover previews are cached in `data/timeline-previews/` on demand.
- `data/` is gitignored so your personal library state does not get committed to GitHub.

### Tech Stack

- Backend: Node.js + Fastify
- Database: SQLite (`better-sqlite3`)
- Frontend: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Media probing: `ffprobe-static`
- Thumbnail extraction for auto-capture: `ffmpeg` when available

### Project Structure

- `src/server.js`: Fastify API, streaming, file operations
- `src/db.js`: SQLite schema, settings, relation helpers
- `src/media-indexer.js`: folder scan, probe, sync, auto-thumbnail logic
- `openCornField.command`: macOS launcher
- `openCornField.cmd`: Windows launcher
- `public/index.html`: app shell
- `public/app.js`: UI behavior and API integration
- `public/styles.css`: dark theme styling
